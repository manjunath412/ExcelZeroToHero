*****This file helps with playstore*.csv, sales_data.xlsx, honeyproduction.csv, monthly_sales, coffee_sales*****
Playstore:
New spreadsheet
From Data, Open base_stats.csv and import
This helps import as a table
Chose data type detection
Load Data
Now on the same sheet, do get data and import adv_stats.csv
Same chose datatype, look at data and other options on the step
Load the new csv data
This gets loaded into data sheet
Spend a few minutes looking at the data across the 2
Return to adv_stats.csv sheet
Select all the column names (1st row) and ctrl+c (copy)
Go to previous sheet
And copy column at the end of the existing columns
JOIN:
Using VLOOKUP
Study the syntax - basically, u look up for a value from the current sheet, on the joining sheet, select the index of the column value you want to fetch from the joining sheet in excel index starts at 1 and not 0; so we want category which is 2, lastly we want exact match
So the ex: syntax we develop will be something like: VLOOKUP($A2, Sheet3!$A$2:$B$265, 2, FALSE)
Repeat the exercise for install column
For type column, we will use INDEX function and MATCH within - to look up value in array, row_numn and column_val. The MATCH will bring the first value that was an exact match
INDEX(Sheet3!$E2:E$265, MATCH($A2, Sheet3!A$2:A$265,0))
Repeat for rest of columns
Convert last_updated datatype to short_date
Aggregated funcs - average rating, total reviews, average_review_per_app which is total_reviews / count(reviews)
Count free apps - COUNTIF(free/paid column, “Free”)

Car Sales (Power Query):
This time from data, select sales_data.xlsx
This workbook has 2 sheets, select shop_sales 1st, and load
Next select emp_id.xlsx to load, here u have sheet 1
Since it does not have column names, we will select transform instead of load data
In the power query editor, we will click on transform → use first row as headers
The row gets transformed, we will name is employee table. Then close and load from menu
It will load the data into new sheet in the car sales workbook
Next we will load prod_id.csv; here too we will fix the column names by clicking on transform like previous and we will call it product table, close and load
Now we will join these 3 tables on 3 sheets using combine queries → merge
Do the merge from shop_sales On merge, we will have shop_sales_data
We will select product table from 2nd drop down, and click on product columns from the 2 sections and we will select inner join
This will now open the powerquery editor. Click on the product table icon at the top, and select p_code column we want to include in the join.
Next we will rename the column name to product id
We can as is customary drag and move the id column next to date.
We will give the name merged_sales_data for this query, and close and load
This will now take us back to the car sales spreadsheet and show on a new sheet
We can do a similar join but experiment with different join types on the employee table

Wide form to long form (wide_form_honey_production.csv)
We will just open the csv directly
We save as Honey Production.xlsx
Copy the content from the 1st sheet into another sheet, add the State header for state column
After selecting all the data on the sheet, insert → create table and ok
We can experiment with a couple of recommended charts for the 1st 2 columns
We will go back to original data sheet
We can do alt + d + p to open pivot table or go from menu (insert pivot table)
Create single page field for me (this is basically the field to summarize on or groupby in technical term)
We will add this to a new worksheet
A new pivot table is added to a new sheet, we can see the grand total here. If you right click on the grand total and click show details, the data will be converted to long form 
We can delete the page1 column since it is of no use. We can also see the auto header naming for the 1st 3 columns
Company Financials xls (Pivot Table more..):
Start with the sheet where the company financials data is present
Insert → pivot table, select table/range as financials (all data should be selected)
Creates a new pivottable on a new sheet
Let us say we want to summarize by product, so drag it into rows and see the corresponding change on the spreadsheet
We can drag and drop say country into the filter area, and see the corresponding change on the spreadsheet
We now want to summarize the units sold by product. So we will drag the sum of units sold into the the values area
We can also similarly drag the sale price to the values area
Lastly, we will drag the profit column into the values!
We can also aggregate in different way. If we double click on profit column and select sum and see the change after ok
Sale price we change to average (by double clicking)
The product dropdown can be further filtered
Play around with country filter, etc..

Sales Rep Numbers:
Choose open file monthly_sales → table1
This is in wide form - every column is separate month, so click on transform
On the power query editor, select sales rep column, right click and unpivot other columns
And you will see the 2 column transformation
Rename the month column to month, and units sold for 3rd column
This shows how to unpivot pivoted form of data (wide), we can call it unpivot table
Close and load
Now we can go back to original pivot data sheet, add a new row, just copy paste and save sheert/workbook
Now if we go back to unpivoted sheet, we can click on the icon next to the table name, and refresh. This refreshes the data automatically

Partition Data, cumulative sum, running total and rankoperations (Coffee Sales Metrics);
We will need to sort by store name, and next level date
Select all the data on the sheet, from menu data → SubTotal, and select sales from the dialog box. See the result for each store
Insert a new column cumulative sale at the end of the table
Do the formula for 1st 2 rows of sales, and then drag drop; do similar for each store
We will now create 2 cells with store and revenue_rank, copy the store names under store
Under the revenue_rank column, we will use RANK(<the value we want to rank>, <the values against which we want to rank>, <ascending or desc>) 0 is desc

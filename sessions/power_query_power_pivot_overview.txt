Power Query
Excel is not reproducible - see steps in powerquery
Excel does not have a native null value. So to handle missing values, we may use different approaches like deleting the record or 0 or putting NA in the field. Powerquery helps address this by using a dedicated “null” to represent missing data
Excel can’t process > 1 million rows - this is true with excel, but powerquery can be used to summarize, aggregate within its editor before loading to excel
ETL: 
Extract: from various data sources
Transform: sorting, filtering, cleaning, datatyping, merging, reshaping(adding/dropping columns or pivoting/unpivoting/transposing) or adding an index column - try it out..
Load: Close and Load loads a table
The formula bar is M language we will come to this later
Data Profiling:
Data accuracy, evident issues, 
Is the purpose /measurement of the variables (columns and values) clear?
Necessary data available and clear?
Any formula/calculated fields and if so are they good or errored?
Use Data Preview in the View menu
Expert tip: original table is blue, transformed is green
Transforming rows:
Remove rows menu item (duplicate, null, removals)
Spitting data into rows (adding index prior to this might give better meaning)
Use fill down (to replace values from adjacent)
Transforming columns:
Column case
Data type (we can create a new data type later, advanced)
Replace values
Split column across
Date transformations are many and awesome
Add custom columns with formula
Also check out close and load to
Pivot and unpivot (“melt”)
merging/appending queries
Maybe filter the case file into separate xls by month
Then append query the 3 monthly xls (UNION)
Inner join/left and right outer
Managing queries:
Group queries
Query dependencies

Power Pivot
Relational data modeling and analysis, construct dashboards and analysis using pivot tables from the data model
Familiar with the trajectory from VLOOKUP to Power Query
Scenario based usage of power query vs power pivot, power query helpful with granularity, 1-off situations, prep-work, simplifications, (ex: monthly sales figures, etc..)
For larger datasets and more sophisticated analysis move to power pivot
Power pivot data modeling creates relationship across tables through the model
XLOOKUP is next incarnation of VLOOKUP but is still memory intensive, and columns are still looked up one at a time
Power query is easier to maintain, and gives more control over output but need to understand relational joins and its implications well, and is still an overhead layer to load power query
Power pivot can create more complex data models and relationships (> power query), more built-in calculations and aggregation functions. The relational modeling is still to be learned here and requires a little more learning, because of the features and is more advanced
Since power pivot is based off data modeling first, the pivot tables can build off these data models instead of constructing and physically building those relationships
Power Pivot is memory efficient of all the tools so far and can scale; also uses DAX language to do intricate calculations, time intelligence spanning calcs, rankings, percentiles, etc..
Need to add-in from file → options
Key points with power pivot are measures, KPI, data modeling(multiple sources)
Data Modeling vocabulary:
Fact tables - quantitative data including aggregates, 
Dimension tables - descriptive data describing those measurements
It is pretty common to see power query as the interim ETL layer for power pivot data modeling, i.e power query for cleaning and transform, changing data types etc.. before loading to power pivot, and use power pivot for advanced dynamic analysis across tables and models.
Cardinality (relationships) - 1:1, 1:many, many:many is the foundation for data modeling

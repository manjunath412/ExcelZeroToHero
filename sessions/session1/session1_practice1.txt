	- tidy-set rules: 
		- try to have variables as columns rather than variable values for columns as here - have a department variable instead of fresh, grocery and frozeon
		- and a variable (count) to represent the counts that are currently shown for each of those columns
	- how do we unpivot/melt:
		- load table data in power query (for selected range)
		- select /highlight the columns to keep and right click and unpivot other columns
		- rename the columns and you end up with tidy data that is organized for data analytics
